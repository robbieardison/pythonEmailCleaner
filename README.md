# pythonEmailCleaner
A Python script to delete emails by criteria. *Please refer to the image-search-criteria.txt file*

If you directly try to access the Google account and log in with your credentials with 2 Step Verification active for your Gmail account, you would not be able to log in with Python 3 party libraries.

So in order to log in, you either have to turn down your 2SV or create an App Password using the google Gmail API.
With the help of the Generated App password, you can easily log in to your Gmail account without deactivating your 2StepVerificaiton, or reducing security.

For protect your email account, I'd recommend creating the APP password and do NOT turn off the 2-step-verification.
